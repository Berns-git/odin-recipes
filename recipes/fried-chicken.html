    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I'm going to show you my version of the famous New Orleans restaurant's famous fried chicken, 
            Dooky Chase-Style Fried Chicken, and although it is shockingly simple, it is likely the most 
            beautiful and delicious fried chicken you will ever make at home.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons fine salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>            
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>         
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Seasoned Flour</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together 4 teaspoons salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, water, and 2 tablespoons of spice mix thoroughly together in a mixing bowl large enough 
                to hold all chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Cut whole chicken into serving-size pieces, ending up with 2 breast halves, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 
                and 2 wings. Alternately, you can use 4 pounds of bone-in, skin-on pre-cut chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces to the egg marinade and toss thoroughly until evenly coated. Press and compact 
                chicken pieces down into the bowl so they are covered with marinade.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic, and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. Toss chicken pieces several 
                times during the marinating process.</li>
        </ol>
